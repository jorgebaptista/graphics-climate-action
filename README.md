# Climate Action Scene

### Description

3D wireframe scene project coded in Processing (Java) using arrays and matrices to create points (vertices) and transform animations.
This project was created as an university project with the theme of **Positive actions to support Climate Action**.

**You can download the executable [here](https://github.com/jorgebaptista/graphics-climate-action/releases).**


### Implementation

The scene was built through programming with handcoded 3D positions in the 3D space without the use of built in Processing commands (such as sphere, PShape, createbox, etc).
Animations were made using transformations such as rotation, scaling and translation, using matrix calculations.
